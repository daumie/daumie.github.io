      <description>Long ago in a distant land, I, Aku, the shape-shifting Master of Darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil! But a foolish Samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me.

      <description>Hello! I am a passionate software developer driven by the motivation to help teams achieve a common goal by leveraging technology.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m a DevOps engineer overseeing in-house Andela software. I work in teams to establish automation pipelines, develop scripts to automate development operations, configuration management and provide actionable feedback.
I am a lifelong learner and I continuously seek avenues to improve my knowledge, skills, and capabilities to both strengthen familiar skills and learn new technologies.</description>

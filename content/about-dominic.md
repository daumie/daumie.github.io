DevOps Engineer driven by the motivation to help teams achieve a common goal by leveraging technology.

I work in teams to establish automation pipelines, develop scripts to automate development operations, configuration management and provide actionable feedback.

I am a lifelong learner and I continuously seek avenues to improve my knowledge, skills, and capabilities to both strengthen familiar skills and learn new technologies. This means that I work with others to  define approaches and execute solutions comprising:

- Linux System Administration
- Cloud Operations ( AWS, and GCP )
- Application Containerization and Deployment
- Web API's Development ( Python, GO )
- Site Reliability
- Agile Project Management to name a few.

In my spare time, I love watching documentaries, spending time online on Twitter to keep up-to-date with the latest news and technology trends.

Stackdriver Monitoring provides visibility into the _performance_, _uptime_, and _overall health_ of cloud-powered applications.

Stackdriver collects metrics, events, and metadata from:

- Google Cloud Platform
- Amazon Web Services
- Hosted uptime probes
- Application instrumentation
- Common application components including _Cassandra_, _Nginx_, _Apache Web Server_, _Elasticsearch_ e.t.c

Stackdriver ingests that data and generates insights via:

- Dashboards
- Charts
- And alerts.

Stackdriver alerting helps you collaborate by integrating with _Slack_, _PagerDuty_, _HipChat_, _Campfire_, and more.

To use Stackdriver, your project must be in a Stackdriver account.

Install Stackdriver monitoring agent and Stackdriver logging agent for your instance.

Uptime checks verify that a resource is always accessible

Alerting gives timely awareness to problems in your cloud applications so you can resolve the problems quickly. To create an alerting policy, you must describe the circumstances under which you want to be alerted and how you want to be notified.

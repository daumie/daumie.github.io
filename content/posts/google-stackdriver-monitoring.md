Stackdriver Monitoring provides visibility into the _performance_, _uptime_, and _overall health_ of cloud-powered applications.

Stackdriver collects metrics, events, and metadata from:

- Google Cloud Platform
- Amazon Web Services
- Hosted uptime probes
- Application instrumentation
- Common application components including _Cassandra_, _Nginx_, _Apache Web Server_, _Elasticsearch_ e.t.c

Stackdriver ingests that data and generates insights via:

- Dashboards
- Charts
- And alerts.

Stackdriver alerting helps you collaborate by integrating with _Slack_, _PagerDuty_, _HipChat_, _Campfire_, and more.
